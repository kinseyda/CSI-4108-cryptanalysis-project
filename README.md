## Description

This project is a toy substitution-permutation-network cypher, and a
differential cryptanalysis tool for cracking it. The cypher is a SPN, with a
16-byte block size, taking 5 round keys of 16 bytes each. The substitution
boxes are all identical, but the processes are all generalizable to a real
SPN.
